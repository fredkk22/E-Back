## Description

This Module 12 Challenge was to create an application that could manage the back-end database of an e-commerce website, allowing the user to create, read, update, and delete categories, products, and tags given to those products.

The reason for creating this challenge was to learn more about using MySQL, using express to create a server loaded with MySQL data, using the sequelize package, and using the dotenv package.

I was able to learn everything I listed above, and look forward to using MySQL along with express servers both in future projects and in the field when I hopefully find a job.
